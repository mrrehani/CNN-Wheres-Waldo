- The original images folder contains images of the entire puzzles. Each puzzle has a number indicating its placement. 
- All of the other folders contain two folders, 'Waldo' and 'Not Waldo', which indicate whether the images contain Waldo or not.
- Folder 256 contains the fewest images, as they are more zoomed out than the images in folder 64 and 128. 64 has the most images, as they are the most zoomed in. There are approximately 16 images for each puzzle in folder 256, 64 images for each puzzle in folder 128, and 255 images for each puzzle in folder 64. 
- The images follow the following name format: The first number indicates which image they are from, and the second two numbers are used indicate which frame of the image they are. In folder '64', they each go from 0 to 15. For instance, frames from the first puzzle go from 1_0_0 to 1_15_15. Images from the second puzzle go from 2_0_0 to 2_15_15. In the folders labeled '128', they go from 1_0_0 to 1_7_7. Images from the folder labeled '256' go from 1_0_0 to 1_3_3.
